# Benefits of Payment Hub EE

The Payment Hub EE abstracts out the complexity of connecting directly to the APIs of an external payment system and provides a scalable and sophisticated orchestration layer powered by Zeebe to elegantly route payments and transactions across various microservices and APIs facilitating the flow of transactions amongst the core banking system, channel applications, and external payment systems. 

Its operational interface and analytics tools allow a DFSP to effectively manage its participation in a real-time payment switch by having the ability to monitor and take action in real-time transactions flowing through system and being able to perform analysis and gain insight into these transactions. 

Its extensibility and open source license enables integrators and solution providers to build an enterprise-grade commercial integration solution.
