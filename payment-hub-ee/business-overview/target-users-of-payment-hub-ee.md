# Target Users of Payment Hub EE

Payment Hub EE is primarily intended for DFSPs to connect to and effectively participate in L1-aligned payment systems like Mojaloop. It provides an open source production-ready tool to directly connect to Mojaloop. 

Likewise shared service providers, aggregators, and integrators providing core banking services and/or Mojaloop integration services will be a key user as they can leverage the multi-tenancy and scalability of the Payment Hub to provide a connection to multiple DFSPs.
